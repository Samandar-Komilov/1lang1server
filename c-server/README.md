# C-Server

This is a part of [1lang1server](https://github.com/Samandar-Komilov/1lang1server/) repository which is aimed to practice pretty much every language by building simple web servers, step by step. The project is divided into chapters, each of which focuses on a specific feature or technique. The chapters are ordered by difficulty level, starting with the basics and gradually increasing in complexity.
> Along the way, we'll explore the related concepts and used function definitions. So, it's not simply writing code or copying-pasting, but analyzing what is happening at each moment.

The overall plan will be as follows:

### 0️⃣ Basic TCP Server

### 1️⃣ Basic HTTP Server

### 2️⃣ Static File Serving

### 3️⃣ Reverse Proxy
