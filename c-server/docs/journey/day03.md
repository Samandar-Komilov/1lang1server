**Building a DynamicArray: Trial 2**  
That day, I tried again implementing my own DynamicArray. I wrote several methods, which in turn nothing worked. I even tried freeing a memory block which was never malloced! 

However I finished basic TCP server implementation at least. Refactored `.launch()` method so that starts the server istance.

I defined very initial definitions of HTTPServer struct, preparing for actual implementation.
